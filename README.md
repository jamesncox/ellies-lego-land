## How it's made

- Next.js with dynamic page routing, slug generation and use of both static site generation and server side rendering
- React with useState and useEffect to handle custom image lazy loading and conditional styles
- Tailwind CSS to help maintain styles, responsiveness and accessibility
- Sanity.io headless CMS integrated as an API
- Navigation that filters by custom or standard build types
- Responsive design with custom media queries to handle multiple screen sizes
- Portable Text converted to block content to render blog markup
